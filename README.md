# nginx side wheel

The nginx side wheel is a user interface for the nginx web server, aimed for developers and enthusiasts that don't
want to manage configuration files manually for their use-cases. Though, isn't the goal to be feature-complete
(if your use case is quite advanced or complex, you probably will not use a UI anyway).

This project is in its (very) initial stages and is far from production ready. More details will be added to this
readme file as the project matures.
